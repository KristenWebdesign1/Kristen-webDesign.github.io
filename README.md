  <h1>Unbroken Heartbreak</h1>
    
  <p>I think I fell in love too late<br>
    I've always been told to guard my heart and let others break<br>
    but I have come to realize the hurt that others feel<br>
    no sorry could ever reciprocate<br> 
    a broken heart destined to a fiery fate<br> 
    I pity the ones who fall in love so early<br>
    cause by the time they are fully aware of what love is<br>
    Their hearts are already <strong>tethered</strong> and <strong>bruised</strong> <br>
    To them, love is just fake news<br> 
    So I wonder if I'm making the right decision<br>
    guarding my heart, full barriers, no point of entering<br>
    But why does my heart feel so weighed down?<br>
    Why every time someone who is good enough comes along<br>
    I'm just "not ready"?<br>
    I've never experienced heartbreak<br>
    but I have witnessed it all my life<br>
    Remember the people I pitted?<br>
    Their hearts were sliced open by lies<br>
    I thought I was safe by protecting my own glem<br>
    It turns out watching a heartbreak doesn't mean you'll always stay clean<br>
    And yes their hearts were stabbed<br>
    but mine is stained with their blood<br>
    I'll try to clean it up in time for when I'm ready<br>
    But try as I might nothing will turn out different<br>
    It's ironic, isn't it?<br> 
    <em>How can a heart be so broken...<br>
    without a single scrape.</em></p>
